## My future

If I succeeded and I get a high value career in Data Science  I would go back and enrol for programming. My goal is to buy a house in a more peaceful place where I can do my work without any disturbances. I would really love to take my cousins to a proper school so they can learn what they enjoy and have variety with it come to career options.  

I really want to also grow career wise I don’t want to remain a junior for a long time at some point I want to to be a Senior Data Engineer.

At the school that I work kids are only taught a few interesting things Photography,  and I came up with an idea for me teach kids programming and I was then told they have to speak to sponsors and and also tighten up security because in an area that I live is most schools are being broken into.
If I become successful in my career I would like to start an NPO and teach the kids in my community how to code because not only do they not know how to code code but they don’t know how to operate a computer and they struggle a lot when it come to  applying for College or University.
