## What might get in the way of your success?

I believe nothing could really get in the way of my success. The weakness that I had was speaking in front of people during stand-up at FNB and I really did find it hard to ask questions and thought I might be seen as a bit dumb and I really learned the hard way because I couldn’t finish my work in time. And I also learned that in this career there really isn’t a dumb question.

At FNB I really did struggle at some point but I made sure if Confluence wasn’t helping me I would ask a different person and even SA’s. When I got home I slept late trying to figure out how to solve my problem. 

I am getting in this career because I love and I know everyday will be a challenge and I am willing to learn.
