## My history

I am Mbali Mtimkulu, I love meeting new people and I believe laughter is the best medicine hence I  always find something to make me laugh. I was born and grew up in Soweto a township in Gauteng. After I finished my matric I worked part time jobs and went on to work as a call centre agent that’s where I got an award for  being the most positive person and always keeping a smile on my face. With the money that I got I from my job I enrolled for a teaching degree in Unisa. I had a friend who was doing Computer Science and used to tell about what they did and he would show me some of the projects they did and I developed interests in programming. I got an opportunity to be in a skills development programme and learn programming for 3 months and I was really struggling a lot so I used my stipend to buy a laptop and practised using online causes. 

Last year I got a learnership from FNB which was six months college and six months practicals, The time I doing my practicals I really wasn’t given any work until two months before the contract ended and I always worked with someone basically I created sub tasks every time never really giver a task of my own. Because the bank was moving from Cobol to Java so we were basically mapping code from Cobol to Java and that was all I did.
