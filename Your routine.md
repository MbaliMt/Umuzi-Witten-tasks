## My routine

I work at a school so everyday I sanitise and scan kids before they enter the school and I am done by 08:30 and I then start working on my Umuzi tasks in the school Library. At 12:00 pm I sanitise and scan kids before they go home, I then wait for get home and sleep and then wake up at 12:00 to finish off my Umuzi tasks. 

On weekends after cleaning I try push as much tasks as I can, that is basically what my routine looks like.
