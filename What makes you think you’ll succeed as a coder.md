## What makes you think youâ€™ll succeed as a coder?

The reason why I think I will be successful as a coder is that I work extremely hard, I am a fast learner and I am constantly learning and wanting to be a better coder. I am enrolled with so many online courses and I search for understanding. When ever one site doesn't work for me I go for the other one hence most of the time I really am on Udacity. Udacity doesn't really teach you the code but they teach you the logic behind the code and make real world examples to make it easy to understand. I am also a person who not only focuses on coding but on other technologies too, like learning Azure fundamentals and Maven.

I would be successful because I am persistent, I finish what I start and I am not afraid to ask for help when I am stuck.
