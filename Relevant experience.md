## Relevant experience

I was in a learnership with Fnb and really didn’t really gather much experience because I wasn’t given an opportunity till two months before the contract ended. I was basically always working on a sub task with someone I was assigned to work with. The bank was moving to Java from Cobol to Java so we received copy books and we used scaffolding to convert parts of the code to Java and the other part we had to code ourselves.

The time I was doing my programming three months course with Johannesburg Centre for Software Engineering (JCSE) we programmed a banking application which had the functionality of depositing, withdrawing money and some other interesting functionalities.
